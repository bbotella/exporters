Exporters installation
======================

First of all, we recommend to create a virtualenv::

    virtualenv exporters
    source exporters/bin/activate

..

Exporters can be cloned from its `Github repository`_::

    git clone git@github.com:scrapinghub/exporters.git

..

Then, we install the requirements::

    cd exporters
    pip install -r requirements.txt

..


After that, we can start using the exporters package.
